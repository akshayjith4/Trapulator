# 🚀 Trapulator – The Chaotic Calculator 😈🔥  

**Trapulator** is not your average calculator—it's a game of skill, patience, and a little bit of luck! The buttons move unpredictably, deflect away when hovered, and only slow down after multiple clicks. Think you can solve a simple equation? Think again! 😆  

## 🎮 Features  
- 🏃 **Unpredictable Movement** – Buttons move randomly, making them difficult to click.  
- 🎭 **Deflection Mechanism** – Hovering causes buttons to flee in the opposite direction.  
- 🔥 **Dynamic Color Changes** – Buttons cycle through colors as they are clicked.  
- 📟 **Retro Aesthetic** – A glitchy, chaotic design that matches the madness.  
- 🔢 **Basic Calculations** – Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—but only if you can catch the numbers!  

## 🕹️ How to Play  
1. **Click the buttons** (if you can).  
2. **Each button changes color** with each click. After three clicks, it stops running.  
3. **Press "=" to evaluate** your equation (assuming you managed to enter one).  
4. **"C" clears the display** for another attempt at controlled chaos.
